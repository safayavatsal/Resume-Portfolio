    "bio": "Hi there! I am Vatsal! You might also know me as TheCode5. I've been coding for over 6 years now. As a Frontend developer I've worked both with startups and small scale businesses to help build & scale their companies. Along the journey I realised my passion existed in teaching and helping students to excel and pursue their dreams as a developers. With this passion, I have now trained some students across the globe. Through live coaching sessions on colaborating with different teaching institutions, I have accumulated good feedback, demonstrating how to apply developer skills in a range of cool builds. I deliver REAL VALUE by teaching REAL WORLD projects to help students enter the world of web development. Youâ€™ll get hands-on experience and learn the skills that are required to succeed in the real-world in this community.",
